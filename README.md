🌱 Krishi Mithra
Krishi Mithra is a comprehensive, AI-powered web platform designed to assist Indian farmers with real-time insights and data-driven tools. It acts as a one-stop solution to help farmers make informed decisions, improve productivity, and manage their crops more efficiently.

This platform integrates soil analysis, live weather, AI-powered pest identification, and government data to provide a holistic digital toolkit for modern agriculture.

📌 Key Features
🧑‍🌾 Personalized Dashboard After logging in, the user is greeted with a custom dashboard that automatically fetches and displays:

Local Weather: Current conditions for their saved location.

Regional News: AI-generated agricultural news relevant to their state.

Market Prices: Key commodity prices from their local markets.

📸 Visual Pest & Disease ID (AI) Instead of just describing symptoms, farmers can upload a photo of a diseased plant. The Google Gemini AI analyzes the image, provides an instant visual identification, and generates a detailed treatment plan (including organic and chemical solutions).

🧪 Soil Fertility & Fertilizer Calculator

Analysis: Users enter their soil test results (N, P, K, pH) to get a detailed fertility analysis and recommendations for soil health.

Calculator: Based on the soil data and a target crop, the calculator provides the exact amount (in kg) of Urea, DAP, and MOP required per hectare.

🌦️ AI-Powered Weather Forecast

Fetches real-time weather and a 5-day forecast from the OpenWeatherMap API.

Provides AI-generated agricultural advice based on the upcoming forecast (e.g., "Heatwave expected, irrigate in the evening" or "Rain upcoming, delay pesticide spray").

💹 Live Mandi Market Prices

Integrates directly with the data.gov.in API to fetch and display live, daily market (mandi) prices for agricultural commodities across India.

🧾 Government Schemes Library

A filterable, easy-to-read library of central and state government schemes for farmers.

Provides clear details on benefits, eligibility, and how to apply for each scheme.

🤖 24/7 AI Chatbot

A floating assistant (powered by Google Gemini) available on every page to answer any general farming question, from crop cycles to subsidy details.
